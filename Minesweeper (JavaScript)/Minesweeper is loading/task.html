<p>To complete this stage, you need to have <em>node.js</em> installed on your computer. If you have not done so yet, please <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">install</a> it.</p>
<p>Welcome to the first stage! You have a default React app, which was generated by the command <code class="java">npx create-react-app appName</code>. To get comfortable with the structure of the React project, modify the code so that the app shows that Minesweeper is loading.</p>
<p>Figure out how to change the text and the picture on the page, then put up the text "<em>Minesweeper is loading...</em>", and replace the React logo with something more suitable, like a picture of a <a href="https://stepik.org/media/attachments/lesson/360753/bomb.svg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">bomb</a>. Donâ€™t break the rotation of the picture and make sure that there's no other text on the page. Finally, change the font of the text: you can choose anything you like from <a href="https://fonts.google.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Google fonts</a>.</p>
<p>After completing the first stage, you can open the app in your browser and admire the beautiful loading page with an infinitely rotating picture!<br/>
<br/>
Your intermediate solution can be compiled and run in a browser using the <code class="java">npm start</code> command in the WebStorm terminal, to stop the server use <code class="java">Ctrl+C</code>.</p>
